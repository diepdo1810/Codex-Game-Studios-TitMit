## Codex execution contract

**CGS-17 QA evidence contract:** Treat task APIs and hooks as optional and disclose when unavailable. A native delegate must actually run to be independent; otherwise use an explicitly labelled in-session fallback. Prior user authorization and host permissions govern all writes. Resolve the selected engine and installed runner from actual files and tools before planning. Do not overwrite existing setup, claim an install that was not performed, or assume an editor is available. Missing prerequisites are PENDING or NOT ASSESSED; changes require their actual authorization.

Resolve the intended project root before executing relative paths: prefer the nearest project containing project.yaml or project.local.yaml, including a nested project; do not silently borrow a parent project. Execute the explicit bootstrap steps in this document before consuming their output. Native Codex does not perform shell preprocessing. Original tool capability scope: `Read, Glob, Grep, Write, Bash(grep -q 'com.unity.test-framework' Packages/manifest.json), Bash(bash "*/.agents/skills/test-setup/../../hooks/yaml-helper.sh" resolve_config *)`. Treat this as a ceiling for this skill, not a permission grant; preserve any narrower read-only restriction in the body and the active host permissions. Use a user-question facility when available, otherwise ask in plain text and wait; unanswered required decisions are not consent. Use native subagents only when available and authorized; otherwise read the relevant role and work in-session, disclosing lack of independent review. Upstream slash-command references mean invoke the corresponding installed Codex skill using its $name; do not assume all skills have been migrated. Source argument guidance: "[force]". 


**Explicit bootstrap (execute before using this output, from the resolved project root):** `bash ".agents/hooks/yaml-helper.sh" resolve_config --keys automation,workflow,qa.level`. If unavailable, report the missing dependency and do not invent results.

**Automation mode**: Resolve `modes.automation` (`project.local.yaml` →
`project.yaml` → default `collaborative`). Every `available user-question tool (or ask in plain text and wait)` call and
every file write follows `.agents/docs/automation-modes.md`
(collaborative asks always · guided major-only · autonomous logs and proceeds;
`automation_always_ask` categories always prompt).

# Test Setup

This skill scaffolds the automated testing infrastructure for the project.
It detects the configured engine, generates the appropriate test runner
configuration, creates the standard directory layout, and wires up CI/CD
so tests run on every push.

Run this once during the Technical Setup phase, before any implementation
begins. A test framework installed at sprint start costs 30 minutes.
A test framework installed at sprint four costs 3 sprints.

**Output:** `tests/` directory structure + `.github/workflows/tests.yml`

## Web / Browser route

When `engine.name` is `Web`, use the project-local `package.json` and `docs/engine-reference/web/SETUP.md` rather than native-editor test scaffolding. If the initial Web scaffold has already created `tests/unit/`, `tests/integration/`, `vite.config.ts` and `playwright.config.ts`, inspect and retain them. Check `scripts.test` and `scripts.smoke` plus the lockfile; existing JavaScript/TypeScript projects may use other runners and must not be converted without consent. If tests are missing, present a bounded plan for Vitest/Playwright or the project's own test framework; create missing test files only after the normal authorization gate.

Do **not** invoke `.agents/scripts/test-scaffold.sh web`: that helper supports native engines only. Instead point to the Web scaffold files as references, preserve all existing files, and report CI integration as PENDING until a real build and browser run. For Web this route replaces Phases 2–5 below and continues at Phase 6 with exact recorded evidence. The existence of a scaffold file is not proof a test passed.

## Phase 1: Detect Engine and Existing State

**Read `references/1-detect.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## Phase 2: Present Plan

**Read `references/2-plan.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## Phase 3: Create Directory Structure

**Read `references/3-directories.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## Phase 4: Create CI/CD Workflow

**Read `references/4-ci.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## Phase 5: Create Smoke Test Seed

**Read `references/5-smoke-seed.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## Phase 6: Post-Setup Summary

**Read `references/6-summary.md` now and follow it** — this phase's steps are in that file, not here. Read it again if the conversation was compacted or resumed during this phase.

## Collaborative Protocol

- **Never overwrite existing test files** — only create files that are missing.
  If a test runner file exists, leave it as-is.
- **Always ask before creating files** — Phase 2 requires explicit approval.
- **Engine detection is non-negotiable** — if the engine is not configured,
  stop and redirect to `$setup-engine`. Do not guess.
- **`force` flag skips the "already exists" early-exit but never overwrites.**
  It means "create any missing files even if the directory already exists."
- For Unity CI, note that the `UNITY_LICENSE` secret must be configured
  manually. Do not attempt to automate license management.
